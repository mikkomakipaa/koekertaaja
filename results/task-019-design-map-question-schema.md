Added a map-question schema and example in `docs/API_SCHEMAS.md`, extending the type enum and documenting the `options` object (map asset, regions, input mode), answer formats, and the Geography-only constraint. Also defined the asset placement/naming convention under `public/maps/...` and updated the API request schema to include map-specific fields in `docs/API_SCHEMAS.md`.

If you want, I can add a concise cross-reference note in `docs/API_SCHEMAS.md` near the main question schema to call out the geography-only rule where the enum is defined.
