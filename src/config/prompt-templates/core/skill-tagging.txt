SKILL TAGGING REQUIREMENTS:

1. Each question MUST have exactly ONE skill tag
2. Choose the PRIMARY skill being tested
3. DO NOT mix multiple skills in a single question
4. Use snake_case format (e.g., "verb_tenses", not "Verb Tenses")
5. Skill is the ability being tested, topic is the content area
6. If a question would require multiple skills, split into separate questions
7. Optional "subtopic" refines the topic (not the skill)

EXAMPLES OF GOOD SKILL TAGGING:

✅ GOOD - Single skill:

Question: "What is 45 + 27?"
Skill: "addition"

Question: "Why did the Roman Empire fall?"

❌ BAD - Mixed skills:
Question: "Complete the sentence AND identify the verb tense: I ___ yesterday."
Problem: Tests both verb_tenses and grammar analysis (mixed)

Question: "Calculate 5 × 8 and explain how multiplication works."
