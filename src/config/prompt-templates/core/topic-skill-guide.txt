TOPIC vs. SUBTOPIC vs. SKILL HIERARCHY

=== THREE-LEVEL SYSTEM ===

LEVEL 1 - TOPIC (Required):
- WHAT content area is being tested
- Use topics from material analysis (identified by topic identification step)
- Content-based, not skill-based
- Examples: "Geometry", "Daily Routines", "World War II", "Photosynthesis"

LEVEL 2 - SUBTOPIC (Optional):
- MORE SPECIFIC content refinement
- Narrows down the topic
- Still content-based, not skill-based
- Examples:
  * topic="Geometry" -> subtopic="Rectangle areas"
  * topic="Daily Routines" -> subtopic="School activities"
  * topic="World War II" -> subtopic="Pearl Harbor"

LEVEL 3 - SKILL (Required):
- HOW / WHAT COGNITIVE OPERATION is being tested
- What mental process does the student use to answer?
- Skill-based, not content-based
- Examples: "multiplication", "verb_tenses", "recall", "cause_effect"

=== KEY PRINCIPLE ===

TOPIC/SUBTOPIC = Content (nouns, concepts, themes)
SKILL = Ability (verbs, operations, cognitive processes)

Ask yourself: "What is this question ABOUT?" -> Topic
Ask yourself: "What does the student DO to answer?" -> Skill

=== DECISION FLOWCHART ===

Step 1: TOPIC - What content area from material analysis?
-> Use one of the identified topics from topic identification step
-> Example: Material about geometry -> topic = "Pinta-alat"

Step 2: SUBTOPIC (optional) - Can I be more specific?
-> If the topic is broad and this question focuses on one part, add subtopic
-> Example: topic="Pinta-alat" -> subtopic="Suorakulmio"
-> If topic is already specific, skip subtopic

Step 3: SKILL - What does the student DO?
-> Look at the question type and what operation is required
-> Use the skill selection guide below

=== SKILL SELECTION GUIDE BY OPERATION ===

1. STUDENT MUST CALCULATE/COMPUTE:
   Math operations: multiplication, division, addition, subtraction
   Applied math: area_calculation, volume_calculation, percentage_calculation
   Physics/Chemistry: formula_application

2. STUDENT MUST RECALL FACT:
   Skills: recall, factual_knowledge, memorization
   Use when: Question asks "What is...", "Who was...", "When did..."

3. STUDENT MUST UNDERSTAND CONCEPT:
   Skills: comprehension, conceptual_understanding, interpretation
   Use when: Question asks "What does... mean?", "Explain the concept..."

4. STUDENT MUST APPLY RULE/GRAMMAR:
   Language: verb_tenses, grammar_application, sentence_structure
   Math: formula_application, rule_application
   Use when: Question asks "Complete with correct form...", "Apply the rule..."

5. STUDENT MUST ANALYZE/EXPLAIN WHY:
   Skills: cause_effect, analysis, critical_thinking, comparison
   Use when: Question asks "Why...", "Compare...", "Analyze..."

6. STUDENT MUST CREATE/PRODUCE:
   Skills: writing, composition, creative_expression, problem_solving
   Use when: Question asks "Write a paragraph...", "Create a solution..."

7. STUDENT MUST IDENTIFY/CLASSIFY:
   Skills: identification, classification, pattern_recognition, categorization
   Use when: Question asks "Which type...", "Classify...", "Identify the pattern..."

=== LANGUAGE SUBJECTS: SPECIAL CASE ===

Language questions can have grammar concepts as TOPIC:

Grammar-focused material:
- topic: "Present Simple" (grammar concept from material)
- subtopic: "Third person singular" (specific grammar point)
- skill: "verb_tenses" (the skill being tested)

Theme-focused material:
- topic: "School Life" (thematic content from material)
- subtopic: "Daily schedule" (specific theme)
- skill: "verb_tenses" (the skill being tested)

Both are correct. It depends on what the material is ABOUT:
- Grammar textbook chapter on tenses -> topic IS the grammar concept
- Thematic unit about school -> topic IS the theme, skill tests grammar

=== COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID ===

X WRONG: Using skill as topic
Question: "Calculate 5 x 8"
- topic: "multiplication" <- WRONG (this is a skill)
- skill: "calculation" <- WRONG (too vague)
CORRECT:
- topic: "Kertotaulu" (content area)
- skill: "multiplication" (operation)

X WRONG: Using topic as skill
Question: "What is the capital of Finland?"
- topic: "Geography"
- skill: "Finland" <- WRONG (this is content)
CORRECT:
- topic: "Nordic Countries" (content area)
- skill: "recall" (operation)

X WRONG: Too general skill
Question: "Complete: I ___ to school."
- skill: "grammar" <- WRONG (too vague)
CORRECT:
- skill: "verb_tenses" (specific grammar skill)

X WRONG: Too general topic
Question: "Calculate rectangle area"
- topic: "Math" <- WRONG (too broad)
CORRECT:
- topic: "Pinta-alat" (specific math area)

X WRONG: Mixing content and skill in topic
Question: "Order water cycle steps"
- topic: "Sequencing" <- WRONG (this is skill)
- skill: "water_cycle" <- WRONG (this is content)
CORRECT:
- topic: "Water Cycle" (content)
- skill: "sequential_ordering" (operation)

=== VALIDATION CHECKLIST ===

For each question, verify:

1. Topic is CONTENT-based (noun/concept)
   - Answers: "What is this question about?"
   - Should match one of the identified topics from material analysis

2. Skill is OPERATION-based (verb/ability)
   - Answers: "What does the student DO to answer this?"
   - Should match skill taxonomy for the subject type

3. Subtopic (if used) is MORE SPECIFIC content
   - Narrows the topic
   - Still content-based (not skill)

4. Topic + Skill combination makes sense
   - Bad: topic="multiplication", skill="geometry"
   - Good: topic="Geometry", skill="area_calculation"

5. No duplication between topic and skill
   - Bad: topic="Verb Tenses", skill="verb_tenses"
   - Good: topic="Present Simple", skill="verb_tenses"

=== QUICK REFERENCE TABLE ===

| Question Type | Topic (Content) | Subtopic | Skill (Operation) |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|-------------------|
| Math calculation | "Pinta-alat" | "Suorakulmio" | "area_calculation" |
| Math formula | "Pinta-alat" | "Suorakulmio" | "formula_recall" |
| Grammar fill-in | "Daily Routines" | "School" | "verb_tenses" |
| Grammar rule | "Present Simple" | "Formation" | "grammar_knowledge" |
| Vocabulary | "Animals" | "Pets" | "word_meaning" |
| History date | "Independence" | null | "recall" |
| History why | "Ancient Rome" | "Fall" | "cause_effect" |
| Timeline order | "20th Century" | null | "chronological_ordering" |
| Definition | "Photosynthesis" | null | "comprehension" |
| Matching | "Nordic Countries" | "Capitals" | "matching_pairs" |

=== WHEN IN DOUBT ===

1. Look at identified topics from material analysis -> Use as topic
2. Ask "What does student DO?" -> That's the skill
3. If topic is broad, add subtopic to narrow it down
4. Check skill taxonomy file for your subject type
5. Verify: Topic = noun (content), Skill = verb (operation)
