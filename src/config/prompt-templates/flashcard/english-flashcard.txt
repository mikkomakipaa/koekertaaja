# English Flash Card Creator

**Your Mission:** Create {{question_count}} flash cards to help a {{grade_context}} student learn English vocabulary and grammar.

## How Flash Cards Work

Flash cards help students **actively recall** what they've learned (not just recognize answers).
Focus on:
- Key vocabulary and grammar rules students truly need to remember
- Clear, simple questions with helpful explanations
- Connections between language concepts
- Real-world usage examples

## Topics You'll Cover

Create **exactly 10 cards per topic** to ensure balanced practice:

{{topics_list}}

**Important:**
- Tag every card with its topic (copy the exact spelling from above)
- Distribute cards evenly: ~{{questions_per_topic}} per topic (you can vary by ±1 if needed)
- Don't invent new topics—stick to the list above

---

## Card Types (Use Only These 3)

**You'll create 3 types of cards in this ratio:**
- **60% fill_blank** – Best for vocabulary, verb forms, and sentence completion
- **30% short_answer** – For grammar explanations and translations
- **10% matching** – Connect words with meanings or examples

Each card must be one of these three types. See examples below.

---

## Card Type Examples

### 1. FILL_BLANK (Fill in the Blank)
Perfect for vocabulary and verb forms.

**Structure:**
- One clear blank to fill
- Context helps student remember
- Answer is ONE WORD or SHORT PHRASE

**Example:**
```
Question: "I ___ to school every day. (verb: go, present simple)"
Answer: "go"
Also accept: ["walk", "cycle"]
Explanation: "We use 'go' in present simple for regular actions. Remember: I/you/we/they + verb base form. The sentence describes a daily routine."
```

---

### 2. SHORT_ANSWER
Tests understanding and translation.

**Structure:**
- Open question requiring thought
- Answer is a word, phrase, or short sentence
- Student must construct the answer

**Example:**
```
Question: "Käännä suomeksi: 'The cat is sleeping on the sofa.'"
Answer: "Kissa nukkuu sohvalla"
Also accept: ["Kissa nukkuu sohvalla.", "Kissa nukkuu sohvan päällä"]
Explanation: "'Is sleeping' is present continuous (am/is/are + verb-ing) used for actions happening now. 'On the sofa' = 'sohvalla' (location)."
```

---

### 3. MATCHING (Matching Pairs)
Connect words with their meanings or examples.

**Structure:**
- English words and Finnish translations
- Verbs and their forms
- Words and example sentences
- Use 3-6 pairs (not too many!)

**Example:**
```
Question: "Yhdistä englannin sana oikeaan suomennokseen:"
Pairs: [
  {"left": "happy", "right": "iloinen"},
  {"left": "sad", "right": "surullinen"},
  {"left": "angry", "right": "vihainen"},
  {"left": "tired", "right": "väsynyt"}
]
Explanation: "These are common feeling words (adjectives). Use them to describe how someone feels: I am happy. She is tired."
```

## Writing Great Explanations

Help students understand WHY, not just WHAT:
- Explain grammar rules in simple terms
- Give context and real-world usage examples
- Show word patterns or connections
- Include pronunciation tips when helpful
- Keep it friendly and clear: 20-300 characters

**Tone:**
- Friendly and encouraging
- No complex grammar jargon unless explained
- Stick strictly to provided material
- Use both English and Finnish for clarity

---

## JSON Output Format

**Return ONLY a JSON array** (no other text):

```json
[
  {
    "question": "Question text (can include Finnish instructions)",
    "type": "fill_blank" | "short_answer" | "matching",
    "topic": "Topic name",  // Required! Use exact topic name from list above
    "correct_answer": "the right answer",
    "acceptable_answers": ["alternative 1", "alternative 2"],  // optional
    "pairs": [{"left": "item1", "right": "item2"}],  // only for matching, 3-6 pairs
    "explanation": "Clear, helpful explanation in Finnish or English (20-300 chars). Include grammar rules and examples."
  }
]
```
