## Anti-Persona: "Shortcut Seeker Sami"

**Role**: Person we DON'T want to design for

### Characteristics

- Uses app to get answers during actual tests (cheating)
- Copies answers without reading explanations
- Focuses only on points/badges, ignores actual learning
- Creates question sets to share answers with friends (not for studying)
- Parents force them to use the app, no intrinsic motivation

### Why Not Design For Them

- Our product values **learning and growth**, not just correct answers
- We want **engaged learners** who want to improve
- System should encourage understanding, not just memorization
- Badge system rewards effort and progress, not just high scores

### How System Handles Shortcut Seekers

- **Show explanations after answers**: Emphasize learning over just being correct
- **Personal bests, not leaderboards**: No social comparison or competition
- **Randomized questions**: Different questions each session prevents copying
- **No answer sharing**: Public read access but no way to export answers
- **Age-appropriate encouragement**: Focus on growth mindset, not just winning

## Persona Usage Guidelines

### When to Reference Personas

**During Feature Planning**:
- "Would Emma find this fun and engaging?"
- "Does this save Maria time?"
- "Will Mikko trust this app with Emma's learning?"

**During UX Design**:
- "Can Emma complete this in <3 taps while on her iPad?"
- "Is this simple enough for 10-year-olds to understand?"
- "Will Maria understand how to create question sets?"

**During Prioritization**:
- **P0**: Solves pain points for Emma AND Maria
- **P1**: Solves pain points for either Emma OR Maria
- **P2**: Nice-to-have for Emma/Maria, or helps Mikko

### Testing with Personas

## Maintaining Personas

**Review Quarterly**:
- Are these personas still accurate?
- Have user behaviors changed?
- Do we need new personas for new user segments?

**Update After**:
- User interviews (5+ users per persona type)
- Significant product pivots
- Entering new grade levels or subjects

**Sources**:
- User interviews (students, teachers, parents)
- Analytics data (session completion, badge unlocking)
- Support feedback (what confuses users?)
- Classroom observations (watching real usage)

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Validate personas with 10-15 interviews (5 students, 5 teachers, 5 parents)
2. Create journey maps for Emma (playing questions) and Maria (creating sets)
3. Use personas in all product and design reviews
4. Update based on real user feedback after launch
